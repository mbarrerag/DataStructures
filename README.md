# DataStructures
Data Structures Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures Repository! This repository contains various data structures implemented. These data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and can be used to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.

List of Data Structures
Arraly: An array-based list implementation that provides dynamic resizing and efficient random access.

#BinaryTree: 
An implementation of a binary tree, a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children.

#AVLTree: 
An AVL tree implementation, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains a balance factor to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Queue: A queue data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It supports enqueue (adding elements to the end) and dequeue (removing elements from the front) operations.

Stack: A stack data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It supports push (adding elements to the top) and pop (removing elements from the top) operations.

DoubleLinkedList: A doubly linked list implementation, where each node contains references to both the previous and next nodes. It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

LinkedList: A singly linked list implementation, where each node contains a reference to the next node. It supports efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

Hash: A hash data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices, providing efficient retrieval and storage of key-value pairs.

Usage
Each data structure is implemented in its own file and can be used independently by importing the corresponding class.

To use a data structure from the DataStructures repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mbarrerag/DataStructures.git

Navigate to the desired data structure directory.

Import the class into your Java program: import com.github.mbarrerag.datastructures.DataStructureClassName;

Create an instance of the data structure: DataStructureClassName dataStructure = new DataStructureClassName();

Utilize the available methods to interact with the data structure.
